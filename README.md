# Regional Music DNA

Exploring how musical characteristics vary geographically using streaming data and cultural analysis.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes regional music preferences across major US cities using Spotify's audio features and demographic data to understand how geography shapes musical identity.

## Research Questions

- Do coastal cities favor different musical characteristics than inland areas?
- How does local music scene history influence current streaming patterns?
- Are there "musical borders" that don't align with political borders?
- What role do demographics, climate, and culture play in regional music taste?

## Data Sources
- **Spotify Web API**: Track audio features, playlist data
- **US Census Bureau**: Demographic and geographic data
- **Last.fm API**: Historical listening trends
